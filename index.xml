      <description>Four hours into the bike ride my head starts to slot itself back together. Thoughts become clearer and everything begins to make sense again.

      <description>I’m a big fan of Kathryn Grace website. She’s a champion of service design, helping to establish the North as a breeding ground for the discipline. Obviously I jumped at the opportunity to take part in a jam as part of Design Manchester.
So what is service design anyway? Think of service design as user experience for life. It’s a way of looking at every interaction, touchpoint and challenge a person might encounter using our services.</description>

      <description>The Challenge Reduce the amount of time a patient spends in hospital during the discharge process and minimise the risks involved for patients beginning Warfarin treatment.
The Team A 6 strong team of doctors, consultants, patients and designers.
Key to our early success was the inclusion of a junior doctor whose intimate knowledge of Warfarin treatment immediately earned her Project Champion status.
The doctors on our team described a complex discharge process reliant on detailed dosages, continual monitoring and multiple stakeholders.</description>
